        <p class="text1 ">Today, the whole country is going through really difficult and dark times. Everyone is making efforts for our victory as much as they can, some with weapons in their hands, some economically, some informationally, and so on. Therefore, we students of the national university also decided to make our small contribution to the development of our state within the framework of the democratic project. On this site, you will be able to view the information that we want to share with you.

    <p class="h2">Why is the Ukrainian language so important?</p>
     <div class="T3 ">
        <p class="text2 ">If the Ukrainian language was not so important, it would never have been banned more than 100 times in the last 350 years! <hr color="white"> 
            The Ukrainian language has a centuries-old history and is one of the sweetest in the world. In addition, speaking Ukrainian you will have a special charm, because almost every resident of our country can speak Russian, but only a few can speak refined Ukrainian. By communicating in Ukrainian, you help the economy of the state. The more people communicate in Ukrainian, the greater the need for foreign companies to adapt their products to our language. And this not only creates additional obstacles for competitors of Ukrainian firms, but also provides an opportunity to earn money for our people and companies, in particular, by providing services related to that adaptation. Communicating exclusively in the Ukrainian language, you become more protected from the penetration of unfriendly propaganda. It is not for nothing that Russia spends billions of dollars every year on the operation of its propaganda channels, such as RussiaToday. The language also ensures the connection of generations and the continuity of the cultural and historical heritage of the people of Ukraine. Even if your parents are Russian-speaking, their parents were most likely Ukrainian-speaking, as well as all previous generations of your family. A good example is a situation when there is a threat to life. You will be able to distinguish "yours" from the "aggressor". For example, the war in Eastern Ukraine, where Russian is used on both sides. If we ourselves, living at home, do not respect our own history, culture and language, how will other peoples respect us? There will be no need to explain to a foreigner why you, a Ukrainian from Ukraine, speak only Russian. It will also force foreigners who come to study, work or live in Ukraine to learn the Ukrainian language, not the Russian language. So, as the events of recent decades show, Russia has repeatedly used the issue of the Russian language when it was necessary to influence the political or economic situation in Ukraine. In addition, the events of 2014 demonstrated that it is dangerous to speak too much Russian, and from February 24, 2022, people should think about whether it is time for us to finally break off all relations with Russia, including linguistic ones?

    <div class="histori"> Do you know who killed the author of the world-famous Shchedrik Mykola Leontovich? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who tore off Maksym Rylskyi's mustache with a piece of skin and meat during the interrogations? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who shot the author of the famous book "Soul of the Stone", bandurist Hnat Hotkevich? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who drove Mykola Khvylovy or Mykola Skrypnyk to commit suicide? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who killed Les Kurbas and Mykola Kulish with one bullet to... save money? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who shot Mykola Zerov and why? And Valerian Pidmohylny, Myroslav Irchan, Mark Voronoy, Yevhen Pluzhnyk, Hryhoriy Kosynka, Mike Johanson...? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who and under which articles Serhiy Parajanov was imprisoned after the high-profile premiere of "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors"? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who burned all the notes of Vasyl Barvinskyi in the yard of the Lviv Conservatory, and then "donated" 10 years of concentration camps together with his wife, the daughter of the famous scientist Ivan Puluy?! <hr color="white">
        Do you know why Anna Sten, Serhiy Lyfar Mykhailo Lomatskyi left abroad? And the sons of the famous Hutsul writer Peter Shekeryk Donykov, who himself went missing?! <hr color="white">
        Do you know who forbade the creation of the first theoretician of Ukrainian folk dance, Vasyl Verkhovynts? <hr color="white">
        Do you know why Lyudmila Starytska - Chernyakhivska served hard labor? And Paraska Plytka - Horytsvit? Olga Nesterenko? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who and why forever forbade Oleksandr Dovzhenko to return home to Ukraine? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who hanged Volodymyr Ivasyuk, the author of the famous "Red Ruta" and other Ukrainian hits? <hr color="white">
        Do you know who killed Vasyl Stus in a prison cell? <hr color="white">
        And maybe you know...? <hr color="white">
        The answer to all "you know" is known and one: Soviet power, totalitarian system, mozKali, Russian cattle, which has been destroying our flowers, our artists, our language, our traditions, our culture for several centuries, and these "and you know who and why.. ." - a cloud, because Russia cannot accept that Ukraine and its people are free, wise, unconquered and extremely brave. Because even under the barrel of an enemy Russian machine gun, our Ukrainians joke and sing songs. <hr color="white">
        Please know. And most importantly, remember and tell others: who, why, why, for what and how. Ignorance sometimes destroys us. And unpunished evil, unfortunately, always returns... As it is now. <hr color="white">
        <div class="left">     P.S. I'm sure you can continue this list. But let me remind you about these "but you know" and at what price... <hr color="white">
